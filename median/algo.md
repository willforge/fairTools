# median algorythm

 1. people (editors) submit text and leave a trail to the "wlog" hisotry
    this log can grow to millions of text!!!

 2. other (rankers) collect a list of text from the "presents" editors on the network
    (discovery w/ findprovs using editor_label_nid)
    (i.e. they download a wlog in sync with their peers) : they have a list of text

 3. rankers start to rank a few text (their own choice)
    my scoring text median trees are constructed and published
   
 4. rankers update their median tree from the "presents" rankers on the network
    (discovery w/ findprovs using ranke_lable_nid)
    with updated scores they can sort their own list by popularity.

 5. a the end of the ranking period each ranker should have the "winning median"
