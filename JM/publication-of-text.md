## readers

1. get "global merkle dag" for text

A : ordered list of 10 texts
B : ordered list of 10 texts

A:10 âˆ© B:10 = {:5}

A:10 + B:10 = A':15 
C:5 = maj(A':15,B:10)

A is publishing A' and C where C is the result of the majority judgement for A,B


Question: can we trust C ? 

given an other node D, D can verify independently C by redoing the math with published A'

C':5 = maj(A':15,B:10)

if C' == C then A' is honest !

C:5 + D:10 ?
